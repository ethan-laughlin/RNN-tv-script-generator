    "Implement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:\n",

    " - `init_hidden` - The initialization function for an LSTM/GRU hidden state\n",
    " - `forward` - Forward propagation function.\n",

    "1) Sequence Length: I chose a sequence length of 50 to give the network a context of approximately 10 script lines on average to consider during training. This was derived from the fact that the average number of words per line was 5.5. Mode of thought: The more context the network could learn from while maintaining efficient training, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Epochs: I started out with 10 epochs as a first trial run to make sure the network would train and increased it to 20 thereafter. With 20 epochs the training loss settled around 2.2 which passed the initial requirement of less than 3.5; however, it was clear that the network could go even lower so I doubled the number of epochs to 40. At this point the loss further decrease but was starting to struggle to decrease consistently. Final training loss converged around 0.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Batch Size: Initially started with 256 as an arbitrary start point. Saw that the network was training efficiently but wanted to increase the number of batches being trained from per epoch so I cut this in half to 128. Network continued to train efficiently with no GPU memory issues encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Embedding Dimension: Considered that the vocab contained ~46,367 unique words and cut this down significantly by 98% to 1000 embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Hidden Dimension: Chose 256 hidden dimensions to give the network a solid amount of features/states to learn from. Based on examples seen during coursework.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) n_layers: Chose 2 layers since we've learned in the coursework that 2 layers is often better than 1 but 3 layers may or may not be better than 2. Additionaly, 3 layers would have added additional complexity to the network and unnecessarily slow down training.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Learning Rate: Started with the default ADAM Optimizer learning rate of 0.001 and determined that it was sufficient to maintain efficient training."

    "You can see that there are multiple characters that say (somewhat) complete sentences, but it doesn't have to be perfect! It takes quite a while to get good results, and often, you'll have to use a smaller vocabulary (and discard uncommon words), or get more data.  The Seinfeld dataset is about 3.4 MB, which is big enough for our purposes; for script generation you'll want more than 1 MB of text, generally. \n",
